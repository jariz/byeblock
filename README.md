# byeblock
ByeBlock unblocks the geoblocking on SoundCloud.

##Description
SoundCloud recently introduced a geoblock feature to tracks, blocking A LOT of tracks when you are visiting from any country that isn't the states.

ByeBlock routes the part in soundcloud.com that asks for the MP3 files through a server in the US when it notices the track is blocked.
ByeBlock does not stream the music itself through a different server, leaving you with a nearly identical soundcloud experience.

NOTE: If you are in the US, this extension has no use for you as of now.
Very few tracks are currently geoblocked in the US, but support for multiple locations is currently planned.

##Server
The server software running on geoblock.lol is available here:

If you want to run your own server, please contact me, as I'm planning to add more locations.
